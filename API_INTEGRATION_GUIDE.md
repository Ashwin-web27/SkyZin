# E-Learning Platform API Integration

## ✅ Integration Complete!

The backend API has been successfully integrated with both frontend applications.

## 🏗️ What Was Implemented

### 1. **API Service Files Created**
- `user/lib/api.ts` - User frontend API services
- `admin/lib/api.ts` - Admin frontend API services

### 2. **Frontend Components Updated**
- **User Frontend:**
  - Login page with real authentication
  - Courses page fetching from backend
  - Add-to-cart functionality with API integration
  - Toast notifications for user feedback

- **Admin Frontend:**
  - Admin login with separate authentication
  - Course management with CRUD operations
  - Real-time course table with API data
  - Status management and deletion features

### 3. **Features Integrated**
- ✅ User Authentication (`/api/auth/login`)
- ✅ Admin Authentication (`/api/auth/admin/login`) 
- ✅ Course Management (`/api/admin/courses`)
- ✅ User Course Viewing (`/api/users/courses`)
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Toast notifications (Sonner)
- ✅ Environment configuration

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Prerequisites
All servers should be running:
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **User Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000` 
- **Admin Frontend**: `http://localhost:3001`

### Test Accounts

Since we successfully registered a test user, you can use:

**User Account:**
- Email: `john@test.com`
- Password: `Password123`

**Admin Account:**
You'll need to create an admin user manually or through the database.

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### 1. User Frontend Testing
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with: `john@test.com` / `Password123`
3. Navigate to courses page to see API-fetched courses
4. Try adding courses to cart

### 2. Admin Frontend Testing
1. Go to `http://localhost:3001/login`
2. You may need to create an admin user first
3. Access the courses management page
4. Try creating/editing/deleting courses

### 3. API Endpoints Available

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/admin/login` - Admin login

#### User Endpoints  
- `GET /api/users/courses` - Get all active courses
- `GET /api/users/courses/:id` - Get course details
- `POST /api/users/enroll/:courseId` - Enroll in course
- `GET /api/users/enrolled-courses` - Get enrolled courses

#### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/courses` - Get all courses
- `POST /api/admin/courses` - Create new course
- `PUT /api/admin/courses/:id` - Update course
- `DELETE /api/admin/courses/:id` - Delete course
- `PATCH /api/admin/courses/:id/toggle` - Toggle course status

## 🔧 API Configuration

Both frontends are configured with:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api`
- CORS enabled for ports 3000 and 3001
- JWT token authentication
- Automatic error handling

## 📋 Password Requirements

For user registration, passwords must:
- Be at least 6 characters long
- Contain at least one lowercase letter
- Contain at least one uppercase letter  
- Contain at least one number

Example valid password: `Password123`

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User logs in through frontend
2. Frontend sends credentials to backend API
3. Backend validates and returns JWT token
4. Frontend stores token in localStorage
5. All subsequent API requests include the token
6. Token is automatically included in all API service calls

## 📱 Frontend Features

### Loading States
- Skeleton loaders while fetching data
- Loading indicators on buttons during requests

### Error Handling
- Toast notifications for errors
- Graceful fallbacks for failed requests
- User-friendly error messages

### Real-time Updates
- Course status changes reflect immediately
- Automatic refresh after CRUD operations
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create Admin User**: Use the database or create an endpoint to seed admin users
2. **Add More Courses**: Use the admin panel to create sample courses
3. **Test All Features**: Login, browse courses, enroll, manage from admin
4. **Customize**: Modify the API calls and UI as needed for your specific requirements

The integration is complete and ready for use! All the plumbing is in place for a fully functional e-learning platform.
